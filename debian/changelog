  * New upstream snapshot. (r802761)

  * Fixes heap based buffer overflow via specially encoded image.
    CVE-2008-1670 (Closes: #478283)

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * 98_link_interfaces_library.diff - major update:
    - Drop ${QT_QTNETWORK_LIBRARY}, ${QT_QTDBUS_LIBRARY}, ${QT_QTXML_LIBRARY}
      from kdecore LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES leaving only ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY}.
      Those 3 libraries are no longer implicitly provided by any kdelibs
      target. This may cause a few link time FTBFSes.
    - Further update LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of other public libraries.
  * Export ${KDE4_THREADWEAVER_LIBRARIES} and an alias for
    ${KDE4_THREADWEAVER_LIBS} to restore compatibility.
  * Fix offsets in other patches so they apply cleanly.
  * Move usr/include/KDE/Phonon from kdelibs5-dev to libphonon-dev. Update
    *.install files and Replaces for libphonon-dev appropriately.
  * Enhance 19_findqt4_optional_x11.diff patch. Do not implicitly add
    -lphread.
  * Build depend on libenchant-dev.
  * Add 99_more_implicit_link_libs.diff which adds more implicit link
    interface libraries to diverge from upstream as least as possible.
    - In addition, kdecore implies QtDBus, QtXml, QtNetwork.
    - In addition, kdeui implies QtSvg. 
    - In addition, kde3support and ktuils imply kparts.
    - In addition, kio implies solid.
  * Move dbus-1 XML interfaces to kdelibs5-dev.install.

kde4libs (4:4.0.70+svn799089-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot:
    - The latest upstream commit is r799089.

  +++ Changes by Armin Berres:

  * Update and sort *.install files.

  +++ Changes by Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez

  * Add new build depends after Qt4 have updated its build depends:
    libpng-dev, libssl-dev, libsm-dev.
  * Add version to the RUNTIME_DEPS in debian/rules.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * New version of 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff. Still
    incomplete.
  * Shrink *-dev dependency list of kdelibs5-dev to libqt4-dev (>= 4.4.0~),
    libsoprano-dev (>= 2.0.97~). Thanks to Sune Vuorela for determining this
    set from #include's of the public headers.
  * Add 18_always_set_cmake_policy.diff patch to set CMake policy settings
    regardless of KDE_FOUND value.
  * Introduce 97_use_imported_targets_with_cmake26.diff which changes the way
    libraries dependences are exported when built with CMake 2.6:
    - Rationale behind this is to reduce excess linkage.
    - Build-depend on cmake 2.6 or later. Make kdelibs5-dev depend on
      cmake 2.6.
    - Do not use export_library_dependencies() to export library dependences
      with CMake 2.6. This method was the main source of excess linkage
      problems. Use a brand new install(EXPORT) instead which supports
      LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
    - Due to the change above, add "EXPORT kdelibs" property for all public 
      install(TARGETS).
    - Rewrite the part of FindKDE4Install.cmake which deals with
      KDE4_*_LIBRARY and KDE4_*_LIBS setup. Since we are using cmake IMPORTED
      targets now and let cmake do a major part of dependency handling for us,
      make each KDE4_*_LIBS variable refer to the IMPORTED target of the
      respective public KDE library. KDE4_*_LIBRARY semantics were not changed
      and they still point to the result of find_library().
  * Add 98_link_interface_libraries.diff which:
    - Tweaks target_link_libraries() calls where dependences where were
      missing.
    - Makes use of LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to control which
      libraries are exported via link interface (property values probably need
      more tweaking). This is CMake 2.6 or only, ignored for CMake 2.4.
  * Make kdelibs shlibs "dynamic" and ensure kdebase-runtime from KDE 4.1
    series is used as runtime dependency.
  * Build-depend on libglu1-mesa-dev as libqt4-dev 4.4.0~rc1-5 is dropping it
    from Depends.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add 19_findqt4_optional_x11.diff - make X11 optional for in FindQt4.cmake.

kde4libs (4:4.0.68+svn794641-1) experimental; urgency=low

   * New upstream development snapshot.

   +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

   * Sort *.install files
   * Drop 16_postgresql_include_path_fix.diff - merged upstream.
   * Add 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff to improve
     desktop file location by path on the systems where e.g. /usr is a
     symlink. Please note this patch still does not fix what I developed
     it for. So it's useless but it does not hurt. Work in progress.

kde4libs (4:4.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  
  +++ Changes by Armin Berres:

  * Don't bump shlibs version automatically on every upload. Bumping on new
    upstream versions is enough now that the libs are stable.
  * Add versioned shlibs to libphonon4.
  * Remove kde-icons-oxygen and kdebase-runtime-data from the shlibs file of
    kdelibs5. kdebase-runtime depends on them anyway.
  * Add strict dependency of kdelibs-bin on kdelibs5 and use a more obvious
    way to remove the dependency on kdebase-runtime. shlibs.local is no more
    needed now.

  +++ Changes by Matthew Rosewarne:
