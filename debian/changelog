kde4libs (4:4.1.81+svn892147-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Resync patches:
    - 01_http_cache_cleaner_branch_881252.diff - remove, stolen from upstream.
    - 01_kross_version_11_r838337.diff - remove, stolen from unstream.
    - 08_add_debian_build_type.diff - refresh.
    - 13_qt4_designer_plugins_path.diff - refresh.
    - 14_hardcode_ptm_device.diff - refresh.
    - 15_kfreebsd_support.diff - refresh.
    - 16_debian_menu.diff - refresh.
    - 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff - remove, incomplete.
    - 18_always_set_cmake_policy.diff - remove, obsolete.
    - 19_findqt4_optional_x11_pthread.diff - refresh.
    - 20_use_dejavu_as_default_font.diff - refresh.
    - 22_hack_in_etc_kde4_in_kstandarddirs.diff - refresh.
  * Update cmake (build-)dependency to 2.6.2
  * Build with -DCMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS=ON.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.8.0:
    - add README.source.
  * Cleanup old conflicts/replaces (for KDE 4.0 prerelease versions).
  * Add new packages for Plasma. They were based on the respective Plasma
    packages from kdebase-workspace.
    - libplasma3 - contains Plasma library and plugins. Make kdelibs5-dbg
      recommend it.
    - libplasma-dev - contains Plasma development files. Build depend on
      libqt4-opengl-dev and make libplasma-dev depend on libqt4-opengl-dev
      since GLApplet uses its header.
    - Bump plasma ABI to plasma-abi-4.2-2.
    - kdelibs5-data replaces kdebase-workspace-data and libplasma2 from KDE 4.1
  * Update install and installgen files.
  * Make kdelibs5 recommend kdebase-runtime >= 4:4.1.80 because some
    stuff does not work (e.g. kwallet) with previous versions.
  * Build depend on strigi >= 0.5.11-2.
  * Move some libkdeinit4 stuff to kdelibs5 since their executables are in
    libexec:
    - libkdeinit4_klauncher.so
    - libkdeinit4_kio_http_cache_cleaner.so
    - libkdeinit4_kconf_update.so
  * Build depend on soprano >= 2.1.1.
  * Use better approach to enforcing kde4- prefix to applications.menu. The
    previous way broken menu spec and made 3rd party applications end up in
    Lost&Found menu. 11_kde4_applications_menu.diff patch was replaced by
    11_default_kde4_xdg_menu_prefix.diff. Thanks to Harald Sitter for the
    heads up.
  * Switch to new installgen file format.
  * Move upstream manpages from debian/*.manpages to debian/*.install files.
  * Build depend on pkg-kde-tools 0.3, add symbols file for libplasma3,
    add appropriate hooks to debian/rules.
  * kdelibs5-dev conflicts with kdepimlibs5-dev (<< 4:4.1.81+svn891439) because
    of upstream changes.
  * Add 24_findkdepimlibs_no_hardcoded_paths.diff to remove hardcoded cmake
    modules paths from FindKdepimLibs.cmake.

kde4libs (4:4.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Add 01_r840377_840379_unload_on_close.diff patch.
    Fixes a nasty bug which makes some KDE4 apps stay in memory when closed
    resulting into excessive memory usage after some time.
  * Readd usr/share/man/man1/kdecmake.1 kdelibs5-dev.
  * Build depend on cmake >= 2.6.
  * Update automoc build-dependency.
  * Replace unofficial 90 patch with the one taken from KDE 4.1 branch.
    (02_41branch_link_interface_libraries.diff). It is the version "supported"
    by upstream with some extra features. It does not seem to be much different
    from the previous 90_ patch.
  * Add 99_conservative_link_interface_libraries.diff which *adds* some more
    LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES to reduce linking failures of third party
    applications. This patch surely does not break anything, it only adds more
    libraries which are eliminated by --as-needed in Debian packaging.
    However, it might help to link a random KDE4 3rd party application against
    our kde4libs.

  +++ Changes by Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez:

  * Rename debian/kdelibs5.bug-presubj to right filename debian/kdelibs5.presubj.

  * New upstream snapshot. (r802761)

  * Fixes heap based buffer overflow via specially encoded image.
    CVE-2008-1670 (Closes: #478283)

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * 98_link_interfaces_library.diff - major update:
    - Drop ${QT_QTNETWORK_LIBRARY}, ${QT_QTDBUS_LIBRARY}, ${QT_QTXML_LIBRARY}
      from kdecore LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES leaving only ${QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY}.
      Those 3 libraries are no longer implicitly provided by any kdelibs
      target. This may cause a few link time FTBFSes.
    - Further update LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of other public libraries.
  * Export ${KDE4_THREADWEAVER_LIBRARIES} and an alias for
    ${KDE4_THREADWEAVER_LIBS} to restore compatibility.
  * Fix offsets in other patches so they apply cleanly.
  * Move usr/include/KDE/Phonon from kdelibs5-dev to libphonon-dev. Update
    *.install files and Replaces for libphonon-dev appropriately.
  * Enhance 19_findqt4_optional_x11.diff patch. Do not implicitly add
    -lphread.
  * Build depend on libenchant-dev.
  * Add 99_more_implicit_link_libs.diff which adds more implicit link
    interface libraries to diverge from upstream as least as possible.
    - In addition, kdecore implies QtDBus, QtXml, QtNetwork.
    - In addition, kdeui implies QtSvg. 
    - In addition, kde3support and ktuils imply kparts.
    - In addition, kio implies solid.
  * Move dbus-1 XML interfaces to kdelibs5-dev.install.

  * New upstream development snapshot:
    - The latest upstream commit is r799089.

  +++ Changes by Armin Berres:

  * Update and sort *.install files.

  +++ Changes by Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez

  * Add new build depends after Qt4 have updated its build depends:
    libpng-dev, libssl-dev, libsm-dev.
  * Add version to the RUNTIME_DEPS in debian/rules.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * New version of 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff. Still
    incomplete.
  * Shrink *-dev dependency list of kdelibs5-dev to libqt4-dev (>= 4.4.0~),
    libsoprano-dev (>= 2.0.97~). Thanks to Sune Vuorela for determining this
    set from #include's of the public headers.
  * Add 18_always_set_cmake_policy.diff patch to set CMake policy settings
    regardless of KDE_FOUND value.
  * Introduce 97_use_imported_targets_with_cmake26.diff which changes the way
    libraries dependences are exported when built with CMake 2.6:
    - Rationale behind this is to reduce excess linkage.
    - Build-depend on cmake 2.6 or later. Make kdelibs5-dev depend on
      cmake 2.6.
    - Do not use export_library_dependencies() to export library dependences
      with CMake 2.6. This method was the main source of excess linkage
      problems. Use a brand new install(EXPORT) instead which supports
      LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
    - Due to the change above, add "EXPORT kdelibs" property for all public 
      install(TARGETS).
    - Rewrite the part of FindKDE4Install.cmake which deals with
      KDE4_*_LIBRARY and KDE4_*_LIBS setup. Since we are using cmake IMPORTED
      targets now and let cmake do a major part of dependency handling for us,
      make each KDE4_*_LIBS variable refer to the IMPORTED target of the
      respective public KDE library. KDE4_*_LIBRARY semantics were not changed
      and they still point to the result of find_library().
  * Add 98_link_interface_libraries.diff which:
    - Tweaks target_link_libraries() calls where dependences where were
      missing.
    - Makes use of LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to control which
      libraries are exported via link interface (property values probably need
      more tweaking). This is CMake 2.6 or only, ignored for CMake 2.4.
  * Make kdelibs shlibs "dynamic" and ensure kdebase-runtime from KDE 4.1
    series is used as runtime dependency.
  * Build-depend on libglu1-mesa-dev as libqt4-dev 4.4.0~rc1-5 is dropping it
    from Depends.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add 19_findqt4_optional_x11.diff - make X11 optional for in FindQt4.cmake.
