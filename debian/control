Description: library for the KDE 4 Plasma desktop
 Plasma is one of the key technologies of KDE 4 (also known as the "Pillars
 of KDE"), and one of the most visible to users. It is the component that
 is "in charge" of the desktop interface; the desktop, panel (often referred
 simply as the task bar), and related elements. Plasma aims to change the
 traditional concepts of the "Desktop", incorporating semantic application
 elements, and bringing cooperating technologies to the user's fingertips in
 a way that is visually appealing while easing work flow.

 This package contains the KDE 4 Plasma library and plugins. It is part of the
 KDE 4 libraries module.
